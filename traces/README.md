A testing name prefix dataset is provided here for simple experiments.

The testing name prefix dataset is randomly generated, and each name prefix consists of three parts:

- Packet type: Interest (denoted by `1`) or Data (denoted by `2`).
- Name length: the length of the complete name string (including all name components).
- Name components: each rule has seven name components, and each name component has 7-10 randomly generated characters.
